This project is a web application dashboard built using Streamlit that allows users to interact with a dataset of vehicle information. The application visualizes the data and provides interactive features to filter and sort the data. The project includes a main dashboard with a histogram of price by make, and a scatterplot of the ododmeter reading by model year.
